## Project Description
10x-cards is an application designed to help users quickly create and manage sets of educational flashcards. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) via an API to generate flashcard suggestions from user-provided text, streamlining the learning process.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
*   **Astro 5:** For building fast, content-focused websites with minimal JavaScript.
*   **React 19:** For creating interactive user interface components.
*   **TypeScript 5:** For static typing, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS 4:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **Shadcn/ui:** A collection of re-usable, accessible UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

### Backend
*   **Supabase:** An open-source Firebase alternative providing:
    *   PostgreSQL database
    *   Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) SDKs
    *   User authentication

### AI
*   **Openrouter.ai:** A service providing access to a wide variety of LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) for generating flashcard content.

### CI/CD & Hosting
*   **GitHub Actions:** For automating build, test, and deployment pipelines.
*   **DigitalOcean:** For hosting the application, likely via Docker containers.

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js:** Version `22.14.0` (it's recommended to use a version manager like `nvm`).
    *   If you use `nvm`, run `nvm use` or `nvm install $(cat .nvmrc)` in the project root.
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)
*   **Supabase Account/Setup:** You'll need Supabase project credentials.
    *   Set up a project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
    *   Obtain your Project URL and Anon Key.
*   **Openrouter.ai API Key:**
    *   Sign up at [Openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).
    *   Obtain your API key.

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd 10x-cards 
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL and `10x-cards` with the repository directory name if different, e.g. `10x-astro-starter`)

2.  **Install Node.js version:**
    If you are using `nvm`:
    ```bash
    nvm use
    ```
    This command will use the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file. If the version is not installed, `nvm` will prompt you to install it.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file (if one exists, otherwise create it).
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Add your Supabase and Openrouter.ai credentials to the `.env` file:
    ```env
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
    # Add any other necessary environment variables
    ```
    *Note: Ensure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive keys.*

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running locally, typically at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Available Scripts

The `package.json` file includes the following scripts:

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the Astro development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
*   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing.
*   `npm run astro`: Provides access to the Astro CLI for various commands.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint to identify and report on patterns in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Astro files.
*   `npm run lint:fix`: Lints the codebase and automatically fixes fixable issues.
*   `npm run format`: Formats the codebase using Prettier to ensure consistent styling.

## Project Scope

### Key Features (MVP)
*   **AI-Powered Flashcard Generation:** Users can paste text, and the application will suggest flashcards (questions and answers) generated by an LLM.
*   **Manual Flashcard Management:** Users can create, view, edit, and delete flashcards manually.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure registration, login, and account management.
*   **Spaced Repetition Integration:** Flashcards are integrated with a basic spaced repetition mechanism (using a third-party algorithm).
*   **Data Storage:** User data and flashcards are securely stored.
*   **Usage Statistics:** Basic tracking of AI-generated vs. accepted flashcards.
*   **GDPR Compliance:** Adherence to data privacy regulations.

### Out of Scope (for current MVP)
*   Advanced, custom-built spaced repetition algorithms.
*   Gamification features.
*   Native mobile applications (currently web-only).
*   Importing from multiple document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
*   Public API for third-party integrations.
*   Flashcard sharing between users.
*   Advanced notification system.
*   Keyword-based search for flashcards.

## Project Status
The project is currently in active development, with a primary focus on delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features outlined above.
